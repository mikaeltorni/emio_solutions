Write me an email for a SaaS company complaining about a bug that disrupted my workflow. Make sure that you suggest a timeline for a fix for their software.

Rules:
- Keep the email polite
- Be clear about the issue and the impact that itâ€™s causing
- Keep the tone constructive, yet not accusatory though
